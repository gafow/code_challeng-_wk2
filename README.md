# Interactive Shopping List

This project consists of a simple interactive shopping list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files Included

- **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the shopping list application.
- **main.css**: The CSS file that styles the elements in the HTML file.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file that provides functionality to the shopping list, handling interactions like adding items, marking items as purchased, and clearing the list.

## Features

- **Input Field**: Allows users to input items they want to add to the shopping list.
- **List Container**: Displays the added items in an unordered list (`<ul>`) with each item as a list item (`<li>`).
- **Buttons**:
  - **Add**: Clicking this button adds the item typed in the input field to the list.
  - **Mark Purchased**: This button is intended to mark selected items as purchased (though functionality isn't implemented in the provided code).
  - **Clear List**: Clears all items from the shopping list.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Type an item in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the list.
4. Use the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

## Notes

- The application lacks functionality for marking items as purchased (`Mark Purchased` button), which would require additional JavaScript code.
- The styling (`main.css`) can be modified to change the appearance of the application.
